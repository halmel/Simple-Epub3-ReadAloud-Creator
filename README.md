# Simple EPUB3 Read-Aloud Creator

## Right Now in Alpha try at own risk

A simple tool for creating synchronized audio books from text books.

Inspired by:
- [Storyteller Platform](https://storyteller-platform.gitlab.io/storyteller/)
- [syncabook by r4victor](https://github.com/r4victor/syncabook)

The goal of this project is to create a simpler, more user-friendly alternative to the Storyteller app.

## ðŸ“– Reading the Synced Book

You can use the following apps to read the EPUB3 books with synced audio:

### âœ… [Thorium Reader](https://www.edrlab.org/software/thorium-reader/)  
**Platforms:** Windows, macOS, Linux  
Great for testing read-aloud EPUB3 books.

---

### âœ… [Menestrello](https://github.com/readbeyond/menestrello)  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android  
Good for reading. One minor issue: the audio playback bar is broken â€” this happens even with books made using Storyteller, so the cause is currently unknown.

### âœ… [Storyteller Mobile App](https://storyteller-platform.gitlab.io/storyteller/docs/reading-your-books/storyteller-apps)  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android  
Supports manual import of processed books. A solid option for read-aloud EPUBs.
