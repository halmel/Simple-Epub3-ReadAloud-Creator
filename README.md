# Simple-Epub3-Realoud-Creator
A simple tool for creating synced audio books with text books 
Inspired by https://storyteller-platform.gitlab.io/storyteller/ and  https://github.com/r4victor/syncabook
Goal of the project was to create a simpler more user acesible version of the storryteller app
# Reading the synced book
* [Thorium Reader](https://www.edrlab.org/software/thorium-reader/) (Windows, MacOS and Linux) â€“ Great for testing
